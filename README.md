Homework for 514 about Git


What I hope to learn from this class is to develop and manage a tethys webapp. I am working on EPANET model viewer and a lot of things I would learn from this class would help in my pursuit to perfect the webapp. Also my understanding of web development would increase which would broaden help my skillset. 
And Dr. Ames is an amazing teacher, so his classes are a lot of fun :)
